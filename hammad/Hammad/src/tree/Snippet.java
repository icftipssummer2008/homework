	Find Count of Single Valued Subtrees (Unival Subtrees)
	Given a binary tree, write a program to count the number of Single Valued Subtrees. A Single Valued Subtree is one in which all the nodes have same value. Expected time complexity is O(n).
	
	 
	
	Example:
	
	Input: root of below tree
	              5
	             / \
	            1   5
	           / \   \
	          5   5   5
	Output: 4
	There are 4 subtrees with single values.
	
	
	Input: root of below tree
	              5
	             / \
	            4   5
	           / \   \
	          4   4   5                
	Output: 5
	There are five subtrees with single values.
	 
	
	
	Merge two Binary Search Trees
	
	Merge two BSTs into one BST in O(N1 + N2) time, where N1 and N2 are number of nodes in the two trees
	respectively. The merged tree should contain all the elements of both trees and also be a BST. Finally, print the new tree in-order.
	e.g.
	Tree-1: 2->1,3
	
	   2
	
	  / \
	
	1   3
	Tree-2: 7->6,8
	
	   7
	
	  / \
	
	6   8
	
	   
	Output from the new tree created:
	
	1 2 3 6 7 8
	
	Or as a  bonus level by level:
	3
	2 7
	1 6 8
	The output above is a tree that's printed level by level.
	
	
	What is the average complexity of a delete operation on a BST? (N = number of elements in the tree)?
	
	O(N)
	O(Log(N))
	O(1)
	O(NLog(N))
	For a tree depth-first traversal problem, if the interviewer says "Don't use
	recursion" or "do it iteratively", what data-structure do they most likely mean you
	use?
	
	Queue
	B-Tree
	Stack
	Heap
	What is the maximum length of the queue in BFS equal to? (Or what is the longest
	a BFS queue can be?)
	
	Equal to height of the tree
	Equal to number of elements in the tree
	Equal to minimum elements at a level
	Equal to maximum elements at a level
	Pre order traversal of a BST produces elements in sorted order
	
	True
	False
